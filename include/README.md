Header Files Directory
======================================

This directory is used to store the header files which are provided for further developing.
In other words, the header files in this directory will be packed into `*-dev` package,
and be installed into `/usr/include/` based on the debian packing rules.

**NOTE**:
  + Please put them into the `<package-name>` folder.
